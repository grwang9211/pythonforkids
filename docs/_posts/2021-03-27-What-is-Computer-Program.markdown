Computer program is a set of instructions that we send to computer for it to produce certain tasks, likes gaming, webpages, smartphone apps, even your home work. You can usually think computer program as something that takes in a certain input and then produce some output. For example, if you create a program that does addition computations, it will take in two input like 5 and 3, produce output of 8. Or you have another program that takes in an English word, produce an output of the same word in Spanish. Input and output can be all kinds of combinations you can think you, letâ€™s say in the first addition program you created, we can change to a similar calculator program that takes in two digits and an operator as input , and produce the output of the compute the result of the two digits with the operator, ie,  if input is 5 , 3 and +, the output is 8, but if change the operator from + to -, the output will be 2 .


These instructions are written in computer languages. Like human, we communicate with each other through languages , computer has it own languages too.  The way we send instructions to computer is through computer languages.


Some of the languages examples are : Basic, C++ , Python , Javascript. 



> Fun Fact : High Level Languages and Low Level Languages 
Computer languages can be categorized as Hight Level , Low Level languages .
>
> - Hight Level computer languages are languages that are more human friendly, they are easy to read/write by humans, and they usually are more compatible with different computers, so an application write in high level languages can usually be run on windows, linux, Mac, or even you phone . But hight level languages are usually slower, not as efficient as low level languages. Some examples of high level languages are : C++, Basic, Python, Javascript.
> - Low Level computer languages are languages that are more machine friendly, they are the direct instructions that machine can understand and execute, they are usually more specific to different computers , so programs written in low level computer languages on windows can not be run on a Mac. But low level computer languages are usually much faster to run than high level computer languages . Low level computer languages examples are : assembly languages and machine languages. Assembly languages is still readable, but machine languages only consists of a bunch of 0s and 1s that are not readable by human beings.   0000011101010111110

>The fact is all high level languages and assembly languages have to be translated into machine languages before executed by computer, the translators are two kinds specific computer programs ( also written in some kind computer languages ) , they are called COMPILERS or INTERPRETERS .
Usually C++, Assembly languages are translated through compilers , while Basic, Python, Javascript are translated through interpreters .
