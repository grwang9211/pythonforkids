#What is code
Computer program is a set of instructions that we send to computer for it to produce certain tasks, likes gaming, webpages, smartphone apps, even your home work. You can usually think computer program as something that takes in a certain input and then produce some output. For example, if you create a program that does addition computations, it will take in two input like 5 and 3, produce output of 8. Or you have another program that takes in an English word, produce an output of the same word in Spanish. Input and output can be all kinds of combinations you can think you, letâ€™s say in the first addition program you created, we can change to a similar calculator program that takes in two digits and an operator as input , and produce the output of the compute the result of the two digits with the operator, ie,  if input is 5 , 3 and +, the output is 8, but if change the operator from + to -, the output will be 2 .
These instructions are written in computer languages. Like human, we communicate with each other through languages , computer has it own languages too.  The way we send instructions to computer is through computer languages.
Some of the languages examples are : Basic, C++ , Python , Javascript.
